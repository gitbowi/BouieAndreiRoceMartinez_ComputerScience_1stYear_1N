Hi! My name is Bouie Andrei R. Martinez, 19, and I am total novice in coding and such.
Even if I am surrounded by more experienced programmers, that doesn't make me scared about diving into their domain. 
In fact, I am actually excited to learn from them and learn with them!
That is exactly why I joined GDSC - So I can learn with others while making memories together!

That is all from now. I will add more in the future as I progress in my coding adventure. 

Thank you!
