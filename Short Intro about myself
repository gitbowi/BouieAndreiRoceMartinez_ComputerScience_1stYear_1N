Hi! My name is Bouie Andrei R. Martinez, 19, and I am total novice in coding and such.

Even if I am surrounded by more experienced programmers, that doesn't make me scared about diving into their domain. In fact, I am actually excited to learn from them!
That is exactly why I joined GDSC - So I can learn while making memories together!
